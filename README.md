# ocr-using-matlab-open-source-project
hi techies, are you lazy like me to enter the information present in the documents and resumes into files manually ? are you tired of manual data entry? then follow my OCR project, develop it along with me, and suggest new development ideas.
# main instructions

->clone the project using the following git repository

->software required : Matlab .

->pls, make sure the matlab is installed in the system or run the files in matlab online.

->now open the matlab and choose the following cloned folder directory 

->Firstly , add the image or pdf you want to the directory of cloned git project.

->now if your document is in the pdf format-

->open the " PDF_2_IMAGE_CONVERTOR.m " and add the pdf name inside the file and run the file. 

->PDF_2_IMAGE_CONVERTOR will convert your pdf of n number of pages in to n images.

->if its shows any error in the process then download the computer vision toolbox in matlab as shown in the suggestion in commond window .

->the converted files will be of format
"srikar.pdf-Page1.png"

Now , to do the ocr , we can use any type of image format like jpg ,png ,tif etc...

Now open the OCR_MAIN.m file and give the image name for which you want to detect the OCR 

NOW run the file OCR_MAIN.m the outputs are as shown 

this is the normal image of the uploaded file
